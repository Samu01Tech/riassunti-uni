# Privacy and GDPR

## Definition

Privacy can be defined as **Informational self-determination**, which means everyone gets to control information about himself. Control is on access, usage, purpose, data transfer...

Another definition of privacy is to increase difficulty in correlating data/actions to subjects.

## LINDDUN

The **LINDDUN** acronym represent the possible threat to privacy. 

*IoI = Item of Interest*

- **Linkability**: distinguish id two IoI are linked or not

- **Identifiability**: identify the subject

- **Non-repudiation**: not being able to deny a claim

- **Detectability**: distinguish if an IoI exist

- **Disclosure of information**: violation to confidentiality

- **Unawareness**: being unaware of the consequences of sharing information

- **Non-compliance**: not being compliant with regulations

We will see methods to protect ID, data and some of the regulations. 

## Anonymization

Anonymization means removing **Personal Identifying Information (PII)**. It has a theoretical meaning.

> Case Study: Netflix
> 
> Two university researchers were able to identifying targets by matching the Netflix Reviews with data from other websites like IMDb.

The case up here is called a **Linkage Attack**, made by joining two dataset with common attributes. You might think removing **Quasi-identifiers** (birthdate, ZIP code, gender) might mitigate the attack however it is not desirable

A mitigation is called **k-anonimity**, were the information contained in the released tables cannot be distinguished from at least k-1 individuals whose information also appears in the release. In short **a quasi-identifier must appear in at least k-1 records**. This can be achieved with *Generalization* (intervals instead of exact value "23, 24, 25 -> 2*") or *Suppression*.

Of course a pseudonym may contain some information on the original identifier so you might loose some details.

A **pseudonymization function** maps identifiers to pseudonyms (different pseudonym for each identifier). However there might be more pseudonyms associated with a single Id as long it is easy to invert the operation. The information that allows the association of the ps. with the original id. is called **Pseudonymization secret**. 

**Implementations**:

- Counter

- Pseudo Random Number Generator

- Cryptographic Hash Function

- Encryption

**Identity Providers** which use pseudonyms also internally offer a better protection in case of data breaches. 

## Pseudonyms in SAML

SAML supports privacy (intended as correlation of actions) by using two types of pseudonyms:

- **persistent pseudonyms** between an Identity and a Service Provider

- **one-time or transient identifiers** so that every time a user access with SSO to a SP it won't be able to recognize them as same individuals who visited the provider before

### Federation via Out-of-Band Account Linking

With this method, the Identity of a user on the IP is hard linked to the Identity on the SP an the association may be **performed without SAML**. Basically the IP pass in the `Response` information about the user. **No privacy is provided**, and it is the standard way of performing identity federation.

> User authenticates through the IdP which responds with the full user identity object. It is then saved on the SP identity store. The linking is done out of the SSO procedure. 

### Federation via Persistent Pseudonym Identifiers

SAML 2.0 has the ability to dynamically establish a federated identity for a user as part ow the Web SSO message exchange. Basically a user is given a common Id that is the same across the federation but data might be different (ie. different username). If the SP does not have the user in the store than it creates it with the id given by the IP.

> User authenticates through the IdP which responds with a generated Id (different from a the IdP's local one). On the SP this is saved together with data and a local SP Id (all of wich may be different). The only thing in common is the generated Id which was exchanged. This is a long-term solution.

### Federation Using Transient Pseudonyms Identifiers

This time a temporary identity is generated by the IP and it contains also attributes to handle Access Control: SP doesn't store any identity in is own database anymore .The SP generate a temporary session kept only in the cache. 

> USer authenticates through the IdP which responds with a fresh Id that is stored only in the **cache** of the SP. The assertion sent with SAML contains only the statement needed (for example being a VIP member). 

## GDPR

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a data protection law that applies to organizations in the European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA). It establishes a set of rules for the collection, use, and protection of personal data, with the goal of giving individuals more control over their personal data and how it is used.

Under the GDPR, **personal data is defined as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person**. This includes information such as names, addresses, and phone numbers, as well as sensitive information such as racial or ethnic origin, health data, and political opinions.

The GDPR sets out a number of principles that organizations must follow when processing personal data, including:

- **Transparency**: Organizations must be transparent about how they collect, use, and protect personal data.

- **Purpose limitation**: Organizations can only collect and use personal data for specific, explicit, and legitimate purposes.

- **Data minimization**: Organizations must only collect and use the minimum amount of personal data necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected.

- **Accuracy**: Personal data must be accurate and kept up to date.

- **Storage limitation**: Personal data must not be kept for longer than necessary.

- **Integrity and confidentiality**: Personal data must be protected against unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure.

The GDPR also gives individuals certain **rights in relation to their personal data**, including the right to access, rectify, erase, restrict, or object to the processing of their personal data.

Organizations that fail to comply with the GDPR can be subject to fines of up to 4% of their annual global turnover or â‚¬20 million (whichever is greater).

Under the GDPR, there are several key roles that are defined:

1. **Data controller**: A data controller is the entity that determines the purposes and means of processing personal data. They are responsible for ensuring that the personal data they collect is processed in accordance with the GDPR.

2. **Data processor**: A data processor is an entity that processes personal data on behalf of a data controller. They are responsible for ensuring that the personal data they process is protected and that they only process the data in accordance with the instructions of the data controller.

3. **Data subject**: A data subject is an individual whose personal data is being processed. They have certain rights under the GDPR, including the right to access their personal data, the right to rectification, and the right to erasure (also known as the "right to be forgotten").

4. **Supervisory authority**: A supervisory authority is an independent public authority that is responsible for enforcing the GDPR within a specific EU or EEA member state. They have the authority to investigate and enforce compliance with the GDPR.

5. **Data protection officer (DPO)**: A data protection officer (DPO) is a person designated by an organization to be responsible for data protection issues within the organization. They are responsible for ensuring that the organization is compliant with the GDPR and advising the organization on its data protection obligations.

## Risk Evaluation

Risk evaluation in cybersecurity is the process of **identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing the potential risks to an organization's information systems and data**. It involves evaluating the likelihood and impact of different threats, vulnerabilities, and vulnerabilities in the system, and determining the appropriate measures to mitigate or eliminate those risks.

There are several approaches to risk evaluation in cybersecurity, including:

1. Threat modeling: This involves identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities in the system and evaluating the likelihood and impact of each threat.

2. Vulnerability assessment: This involves identifying and analyzing vulnerabilities in the system and determining the potential risks associated with each vulnerability.

3. Risk assessment: This involves evaluating the overall risk to the organization's information systems and data by combining the results of the threat modeling and vulnerability assessment processes.

4. Risk management: This involves implementing measures to mitigate or eliminate the identified risks, such as implementing security controls, developing contingency plans, and training employees.

Overall, the goal of risk evaluation in cybersecurity is to identify and prioritize the risks to the organization's information systems and data, and to implement appropriate measures to mitigate or eliminate those risks.
